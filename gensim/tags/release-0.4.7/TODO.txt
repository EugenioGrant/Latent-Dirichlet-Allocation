Changes for future releases:
-----------------------------

* more extensive unit testing
* finish tutorials!
* re-implement LDA after Asuncion: "On Smoothing and Inference for Topic Models"
* and the big one: find a reasonable framework for distributed computing in Python
  and translate algorithms into their distributed variants. Avoid Java frameworks
  and over-complex stuff; follow the main design principles of gensim
