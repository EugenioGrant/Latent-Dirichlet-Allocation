Changes
=======

0.7.1

* fixed a bug in LSA that occurred when the number of features was smaller than the number of topics

0.7.0

* optimized vocabulary generation in gensim.corpora.dictionary (faster and less memory-intense)
* MmCorpus accepts compressed input (file-like objects such as GzipFile, BZ2File; to save disk space)
* changed sparse solver to SVDLIBC (sparsesvd on PyPi)
* added distributed LSA, updated tutorials (still experimental though)
* several minor bug fixes

0.6.0

* added option for online LSI training (yay!). the transformation can now be
  used after any amount of training, and training can be continued at any time 
  with more data.
* optimized the tf-idf transformation, so that it is a strictly one-pass algorithm in all cases  (thx to Brian Merrell).
* fixed Windows-specific bug in handling binary files (thx to Sutee Sudprasert)
* fixed 1-based feature counting bug in SVMlight format (thx to Richard Berendsen)
* added 'Topic :: Text Processing :: Linguistic' to gensim's pypi classifiers
* change of sphinx documentation css and layout

0.5.0

* finished all tutorials, stable version

0.4.7

* tutorial on transformations

0.4.6

* added Random Projections (aka Random Indexing), as another transformation model.
* several DML-CZ specific updates

0.4.5

* updated documentation
* further memory optimizations in SVD (LSI)

0.4.4

* added missing test files to MANIFEST.in

0.4.3

* documentation changes
* added gensim reference to Wiki articles (SVD, LSI, LDA, TFIDF, ...)

0.4.2

* finally, a tutorial!
* similarity queries got their own package

0.4.1

* pdf documentation
* removed dependency on python2.5 (theoretically, gensim now runs on 2.6 and 2.7 as well).

0.4.0

* support for ``python setup.py test``
* fixing package metadata
* documentation clean-up

0.2.0
